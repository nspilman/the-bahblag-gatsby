One of my favorite sites in the word is Florence's duomo.  It never ceases to take my breath away and I could sit and stare at it for hours.  We walked to the duomo on our first full day in Florence and took many, many pictures of the exterior.

One of the Italy books I read is Brunelleschi's dome so climbing the dome was high-up on the list of Florence activities.  Brunelleschi worked as a watchmaker and goldsmith before entering a contest to build a dome for the long dome-less cathedral.  His method involved building a dome within a dome, with the smaller inside dome being self-supporting and the outer dome essentially acting as a shell.  The men that actually did the manual labor for it 

It worked and is still standing today.
