On Thursday morning we went to Constitution Hill before the Maboneng tour.  Constitution Hill is an old prison that was used from 1892 to 1987 to hold both black and white people, though they were treated quite differently.

There were separate men and women's prisons, and the men's prison has more or less been accurately preserved (the women's prison has been remodeled).  We started the tour with a quick introductory video and then walked around the men's prison.  As you can see below, conditions were terrible in the prison.

Gandhi was actually imprisoned here in 1906 and Mandela was imprisoned here during Apartheid, so there were quite a few panels on both of them.

They also have the isolation cells open and available to step into.  It's hard to put into words what it feels like to walk into one of the isolation cells, but I will say it makes you nauseous to simply step inside.
