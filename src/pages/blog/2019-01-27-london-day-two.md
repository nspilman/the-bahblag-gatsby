Nate here!

## A Lazy morning and wildlife sighting

We started our morning slowly. We got a ton of much needed sleep after our previous day of travel, and we spent the morning working on the blog and enjoying the delicious coffee at our AirBnB. Just as we were getting ready to leave, a fox jumped over the fence into our backyard!

Our host Greg told us all about the local foxes, and how difficult life is for an "Urban Fox." Urban Fox is a great band name, btw. We were soon to be off, and Greg was heading in the same direction, so we walked together to the tube. We exchanged travel stories, and how he and his husband want to return to Turkey for a trip, where his husband is from, but are worrisome of the conservative Turkish government. 



## St. Paul's Cathedral and crossing the Thames

We took the tube to St Paul's Cathedral from Finsbury Park. I'm quite impressed with the London Underground system. We can seemingly get anywhere we want, and the train run regularly. Basically  if the New York Subway system ran more regularly, but didn't have express trains. 

We got off at St Paul's, admired the beauty of the cathedral exterior, but didn't want to pay the 20 pounds to get in. We crossed the Thames via the Millennium Bridge, and took in the views.

We quickly made our way to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.

## Swordplay and a tour of the Globe Theatre

We purchased tickets for an hour tour of the Globe Theatre, and had a half hour to kill. We walked around the exhibit inside before hearing the enticing call of "Who wants to see a sword demonstration?" 

Our guide, a woman five months pregnant with twins, explained all about how important accurate and exciting sword fighting was in Shakespeare's plays when they were originally put on. She then walked is through different sword technologies of the time, how they fell in and out of fashion, and who wielded what (nobility vs. the army, etc). 

We were then treated to multiple sword battle demonstrations with different weapons.

We were then allowed to hold them :-)

And just as the demo ended, our tour began! We were lead around by the charming and knowledgeable Sergio.

We learned this this is actually the third Globe Theatre. The first Globe burned down after 14 years, when they set off a cannon from the roof of the theatre for theatric effect. The second Globe was demolished during Puritan rule, after the Theatre was shut down for... being too much fun. For being against Puritanical order. The theatre we were touring was only 22 years old, putting on Shakespeare and non-Shakespeare plays alike. 

While we were learning about the Globe, theater students were performing on stage. They were performing The Changeling", which I admit I had to google.

## Borough Market, a view of the Tower of London, and Brew Dog Beer

Shakespeare gave us quite the appetite, so it was time for a late lunch at the Borough Market. Claire made an observation on the way there - it is customary in London to walk on the left side when passing people, just as the cars drive, but in the tourist areas, everyone passed on the right. The non-British way ruled.

The Borough Market was heckacrowded, so we did a lap and then got in line for chicken shwarma. They were delicious.

 We then made our way over to the Tower of London. We crossed the London Bridge, which didn't fall down (sorry), and through an area that reminded me of New York's City Hall area to the Tower of London, passing the Brewdogs taproom along the way.

It was quite chilly, windy and threatening rain. My exhaustion hit, and I _really _didn't feel like spending $40 a person to tour this tower. I DID feel like grabbing a beer at Brewdogs. Next time, Tower of London! We doubled back to Brewdogs, and enjoyed the heat and WiFi. I grabbed a Dead Pony Pale Ale (delicious), and Claire got a guest tap Framboise that honestly tasted like artificial sweetener.
