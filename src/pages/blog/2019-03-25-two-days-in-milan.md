# Day One


We left our AirBnB in Florence at 8:45 for our 10AM train, stopping at Biote along the way for cappucini and panini. We got to the train and applauded our marked bag schlepping improvement over the weeks. 

Without a hitch, we got on our train and were in Milan an hour and fourty five minutes later.

We checked into our AirBnB, and had lunch on the brain. From lunch, we'd walk down to the Piazza Di Duomo and explore the enomous cathedral.

We went to a place called Panzarroti, which boasted delecacies of the same name. They were sort of like calzones, except the bread was baked or deep fried first, and then all the insides were added. Claire got a delicious prociutto and vegitables panzarroti. I decided to try something new, and got a burratta and raw horse meat panzarroti. Now, I enjoy most food, and love trying new things, but 'raw horse sandwich' is officially off my list of foods I'd ever order again. I quickly removed most of the horse and enjoyed the rest of my meal.

From there, we walked the quick walk to the Duomo. On our way, we stopped to admire a guitarist playing the guitar parts from famous classic rock songs, and absolutely nailing them. We enjoyed The Wall by Pink Floyd and Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits before moving on.

## The Duomo

We get to Duomo, and it is breathtaking. It's the 4th largest cathedral in the world, right after the Catedral in Sevilla, and boy is it enormous. It's also the first Gothic style church we've seen in Italy, specifically flamboyant gothic, making reference to the flame-like characteristics of its pires.

The plaza itself was mobbed with tourists, and folks handing out bird seed to attract pigeons. We did not care to hang out with the birds, but these folks sure did.

We oggled at the statues high up on the building before buying tickets to go inside. We bought a combined ticket which would allow us into the Duomo, as well up to the top.

The inside of the Duomo was stunning. The Duomo in Milan has the most stain glass of any church, and the church was flooded with colorful natural light. At this stage of our trip in Europe I was pretty tired of seeing churches, but this one kept my  attention.

We left the Duomo and it was time to climb! But first, a bathroom break. There was a bathroom next to the Duomo that charged a euro entrance fee. I was in a state of "worth it", so I tried making change of my two euro coin - and so the saga began.

 When the machine wasn't making my change, the bathroom attendant pointed out that I was trying to make two euro change from a Five South Arfrican Rand coin. I left the bathroom defeated. 

 I returned to Claire and realized "Wait, I can make change from my Five Euro note!" I return to the bathroom just in time to watch a middle aged woman fall right in the bathroom change-making area, as her friend shouts "OH, CAROL!". We approach and see that she's bleeding hard from the face. "OH CAROL, YOU'RE REALLY BLEEDING!"

 My instinct kicks in the find authority, and the closest Duomo employees I can find are at the front of the entrance lines. In English I say "Hi - I need here. There's a woman in the bathroom who fell, is bleeding, and needs medical attention." The man responds "You need to buy a ticket at the ticket office to come in." "No, I don't want to go in - I need medical help," I retort, to which he points me to the ticket office. Finally, in broken Italian I say "There is a woman... in the bathroom... " and say "she fell" in Spanish before making hand gestures of impact to the head. "Yes, there is a woman. Go you need to get a ticket." says the attendant. 

 I return to the bathroom to see that Carol is still bleeding. The bathroom attendant sees me and says "You are going to have to wait, sir." I make a B line to the ticket office to see if they can help poor Carol out. I blow past Claire, who has no idea of the drama, muttering "Carol is bleeding from her freakin' head and I need to get her help." We find someone at the ticket office who speaks enough English to understand the urgency, and rushes over right away. By the time I return to the bathroom, the blood is cleaned and Carol is being tended to in the women's room. I insert my 5 euros into the change machine, insert one euro of my change into the bathroom turnstyle, and end the saga of the bathroom. 

 We saw Carol's tour group soon after, and while Carol was MIA, everyone was in high spirits. 
 
 From there, it was time to climb the Duomo.  

We climbed up the steps and were rewarded with a beautiful view of the plaza, as well as closer looks at the stunning spires of the cathedral. From around back we were able to get views of the more modern parts of the city as well.

After the Duomo, we checked out the Galleria Vitorio Emanuelle II, which is the oldest shopping mall in existence. It opened in the 1850s and has been serving its original purpose since, housing fancy restuarants, the birth-bar of Campari, and high end Italian clothing stores.

After a quick jaunt through the mall, we stopped for cocktails at the birthplace of Campari! Claire got a Campari Spritz and I got one of their signature cocktails, Campari and dry vermouth.

By that time it was around 6pm, and we walked back to the airBnB to get ready for dinner. We'd be going to Da Martino, a traditional Milanese restaurant known for their cotoletta - a thinly pounded fried pork dish. Food traditionally from Milan don't include pastas, but instead rice and grain based dishes. 

We got to Da Martino at 7:50pm. As we didn't have a reservation, we were told we could dine if we promised to be out by 9pm. We both ordered the cotoletta nearly hte minute we sat down, and we had our food by 8:00pm.

The meal seemed to get better as it went on, with the wonderfully seasoned tomatoes balancing out the semi-bland pork. 

We were out well before 9PM, walked through bustling China Town to get back and capped the night off with gelato near the AirBnB. 

#Day 2
Claire really wanted to see Da Vinci's The Last Supper. The problem is, when tickets to view the painting, they're all immediately bought up by tour companies and resold. Therefore, to see the Last Supper, Claire signed us up for a three hour tour, starting at the Duomo and ended at the Last Supper. Our tour guide was charming and informative, and but it would have been cool if we could have just seen the painting without shell out for the full tour. 

As mentioned, we started the tour at the Duomo once again. It was a pleasure to go back inside, as our guide Maria shared additional insight that we didn't get from the Rick Steves guidebook writeup. We learned that there are only a few original stain glass panels from the 1500s remaining at the church, because when Nepoleon crowned himself King of Milan in the 1800s, the cannons they set off the celebrate outside created shockwaves that blew out all of the windows.

After the Duomo, we reentered the mall where there was a commercial shoot going on.

From there we passed La Scala Opera House. My Aunt and Uncle played in the La Scala orchestra from 1974 through 1981, so it was quite meaningful to see the place. The building itself was rather unassuming from the outside, but we'd be back to tour the insdie later on.

From there we walked around Milano, hearing about its history before we came to the castle.
