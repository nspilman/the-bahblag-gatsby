Hi all - 

Sorry for the lack of posting. We just spent

## The People

Muweti has 3 chalets that are part of the lodge itself, so it was generally us and two other couples or individuals. These were the people with whom we went on game drives, ate meals and shared the space. Claire and I honestly expected to be the young couple amongst people in their 40s and 50s, but every other group was also either in their 20s or early 30s.

## The Food

The food was delicious - and some meals, especially dinners, were quite interesting. I ate infinitely more antelope that I'd ever eaten before - I'll tell you. 

All guests would come together for every meal, talking and enjoying our food. 

**Breakfasts**

We'd eat breakfast at 9am after our game drives. Breakfast fare was fairly standard - we'd pass around bowls of fruit salad, plain yogurt and granola while Laura took orders for hot food. Laura and staff would make the standard eggs - however you'd like them - and bacon. I enjoyed omelettes or scrambled eggs, depending on the day. There was also toast and croissants available with butter and jam. 

**Lunch**

Lunch is where things got more interesting. We'd eat daily at 2pm, and the meal was always different. Our first day, the main dish was a cheese platter and biltong, which is basically a South African cousin of Jerky. One day we ate ostrich pies. The other two days were more standard - a delicious steak salad and sausage quiches. The steak itself was spectacular - more about that at dinner. 

**Dinner **

After game drives, we'd freshen up and meet around the fire for conversation and drinks before dinner. Mike and Laura would be drinking scotch whisky, and Lynnette or Hardus would pour us drinks on request. 

As magical as the game drives were, dinners were also magical. Our dinners were (in chronological order) Antelope Gulash, a traditional South African brai - the best we'd had, chicken curry and lasagna.
