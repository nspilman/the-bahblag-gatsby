# Eight and a Half hours later, we're in London!

The redeye on Virgin Atlantic from SeaTac to London Heathrow was as painless as it could be (partially thanks to the empty middle seat in the row of three). Nate watched BlacKkKlansman (amazing) and Claire read (later post coming on the trip reading list), before each getting in the ballpark of three hours of sleep. Once we got our bags, we took the tube with our luggage from Heathrow to the Finsbury Park on the Piccadilly line.

This tube ride took a little over an hour. Claire read, and Nate enjoyed the people watching. Once we got to Finsbury Park, we schlepped our bags to our AirBnB, where we were met by our host, Greg. Greg gave us an extended lay of the land and helped us plan our day.  After a brief rest and a quick change of clothes, we were off to Camden Town by bus!

## The bus to Camden Town 

We purchased "Oyster Cards", which is basically London's Metro Card, and hopped on the bus. The gentleman from whom we bought the cards was difficult to understand, so we didn't have a clear sense of how they worked, but we knew we could ride the bus and Claire repeatedly questioned whether we could get our 5pound deposit back (we later found out - yes). We jumped on the bus and enjoyed the snapshot of London city life. We took the 253 line to Camden Town, and enjoyed the animated conversation the gentlemen behind them was having in Arabic. We couldn't understand him, but could tell the story that he was telling was hilarious.

## Exploring Camden Town

We got off the bus and made our way to the Camden Town market. The streets with bustling with people. The area seemed like a blend of culture and tourism, passing a combination of knock off product vendors and artisan shops. (There was a store entirely devoted to combat boots!) The buildings were also covered in statue facades.

We made it to the Camden Lock, at the opening of the Market, and each took a photo.

The Camden Market itself was full of artists and vendors, with food stalls surrounding. We quickly went through the artists stalls, as food was the priority, and ended up splitting a delicious coconut thai hand pie.
