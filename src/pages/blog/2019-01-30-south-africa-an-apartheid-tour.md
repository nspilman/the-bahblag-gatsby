We woke up in the morning at 8am for our 9:30 Apartheid museum / Suweto tour. We walked down the block to the local Starbucks, and I had a standard iced Americano - our barista's nametag said "King Michael." We returned to our AirBnB just before 9:30, and were soon picked up for our tour. 

## Our tour begins

We get in the tour van and meet our guides, Bobo and... we honestly can't remember this guy's name. We feel terrible, because he was great - I think it was Mbosa? I'll call him M. The beginning of the ride is Bobo driving on the left side of the van, and M is chatting with us to our left in the van.

We picked up our next tour compatriot, a British man who just spent 18 days volunteering in Kruger national park protecting endangered rhinos (which we later learned). He was staying near the University, and the area was bustling with students. 

 We then drove to toward the Apartheid museum, but first we stopped off at the stadium of the 2010 world cup. "This is where Shakira sang Waka Waka" Bobo told us with a laugh. We got out of the van to take pictures.

We then made it over to the Apartheid museum, meeting up with our last tour compatriot, a Swiss man traveling all around South Africa in camper. 

## The Apartheid Museum

The Apartheid Museum did an incredible job painting the history of the incredible human atrocities that were the Apartheid.

We had two hours to go through the museum, and Claire and I had to rush through the very end to make it back to the van on time.
