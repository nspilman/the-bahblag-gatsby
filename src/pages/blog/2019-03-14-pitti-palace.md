Nate was a bit burned out from museums on Tuesday but I love the Pitti Palace, especially the Boboli Gardens, and wanted to visit again.  So, I spent Tuesday afternoon strolling the palace by myself.  I started by touring the Palatine Gallery, which took me through grand palatial rooms covered with artwork.  When I say covered, I mean there were often 5-8 paintings on a wall.

It was a bit hard to take in the number of paintings.  Most were from the 16th and 17th centuries and included pieces by Titan, Rembrandt, and Raphael (a very large Raphael collection).

After touring the Palatine Gallery, I went out to the Boboli Gardens and took a leisurely stroll through them.  I even sat down on a bench and read a bit of my book (Where the Crawdads Sing - highly recommend).

I also took a brief look at the Porcelain Museum, which was hot inside and didn't catch my interest, before strolling back to the palace.

I did another tour through the Palatine Gallery, this time to focus solely on the Raphael pieces, before going up to the Modern Art Museum.  I was expecting something like MOMA but apparently my definition of "modern" differs from that of the Pitti Palace.  There were beautiful pieces, but they were all Romantic, Neoclassical, and Impressionist works.

After a quick tour, I went through part of the Costume Gallery and the Silverworks Museum (they had a lot of jewels).

It was a wonderful museum visit and such a Pitti that Nate missed it (sorry - had to do that).
