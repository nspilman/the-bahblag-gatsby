## Overview of the Tour

Claire and I took a full day tour down the Cape of Good Hope, the most Southwestern point of Africa. Per the map below, we started in Cape Town, took the bus down the western side of the peninsula to Hout Bay, before crossing the peninsula to Simonstown, and then down to the cape of Good Hope.

Our guide was Mark on the left - a friendly, chatty and informative Cape Town native. Freddy on the right was our driver, and was full of songs and play-on-words.

#The tour begins and Hout Bay

We were two of seven Americans on the tour, as well as eleven Brazilians. Mark spoke as much Portugues as he knew, which wasn't a lot, and only one of the eleven Brazilians spoke English. Mark introduced the day while the one English speaking Brazilian translated as fast as she could. 

We started the day in beautiful Hout Bay. We were offered a quick cruise around the bay to an island populated by seals for additional money, but we decided instead to walk around on our own.

The bay was full of vendors selling crafts and souvenirs.

From the dock we could see seals and jellyfish in the water.

We were happy with how we spent our time. We enjoyed the beautiful day and until it was time to return the bus. I took quite a few photos.

We then drove up the windy road to Chapman's Peak, where we stopped for photos and a light breakfast. Directly behind us across the water is Hout Bay, where we'd just been.

## Boulder's Beach and a stop for lunch

After Chapman's Peak, we were on to Simonstown, where we'd hang out with the penguins at Boulder's Beach. Mark was hitting us with trivia and history left and right. We learned the color coded flag lingo for reporting great white sharks, and that Simonstown was named after a British explorer who wanted Cape Town named after him but the powers that be said no, but we'll name Simonstown after you, hence Simonstown (yes, I'd get a C- on a high school history paper for this explanation). 

We stopped in Simonstown, and paid the entrance fee to Boulder's Beach to see the penguins. Penguins first migrated to Boulder's beach in the 80s, and have since reproduced into a sizeable colony.
